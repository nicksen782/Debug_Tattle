Debug and Tattle 5


November 29, 2016 -
	User Interface is created.
	Web application is using fixed dimensions of 1355px by 635px. Fits perfect at full zoom on a Acer C720 Chromebook.
	UI uses overlapping windows for controls. Hovering over the exposed portion of a control (left and right sides) will bring it forward.
	Entire tattle is requested and displayed.
	Left UI Controls has command buttons for Refresh, Delete Stale, Delete All, Settings.
		Refresh: works.
		Delete Stale: NOT FUNCTIONAL YET.
		Delete All: works.
		Settings: NOT FUNCTIONAL YET. -- should open a modal window.
	Left UI Controls has navigation buttons that will scroll the main view div to the selected heading.
	Right UI Controls shows the list of tattles (newest on top.) Clicking one will display it. Clicking the trash can graphic will delete that tattle and then reload the list.
		Open Tattle: works.
		Delete Tattle: works.
	AJAX: Active server requests are indicated by a progress bar in the upper-right corner of the application.

	MISSING ---- mainviewingarea_top - the basics - tattle info section still has test data and is NOT coming from the loaded tattle.
