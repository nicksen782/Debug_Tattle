Debug and Tattle 5

Program started November 29, 2016

2016-12-30:
Add a configuration variable that will be stored along with the tattle. This will be used as a record appfilter.
If the configuration variable is missing then PHP_SELF is used instead.
Appfilter also includes the function that created the tattle.
On new web page load the user can choose an app filter to display.
The latest used appfilter will be automatically selected adn loaded.
All views/deletions will be relative to the chosen filter.
